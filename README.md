# Morrígan Project

The Morrígan project is aimed at adding phase detection and model swapping capabilities to the [Structural Simulation Toolkit](https://sst-simulator.org/). 

# Installation
This project relies on custom versions of SST-Core, SST-Elements, and DRAMsim3. Follow these instructions to 
```
git clone git@github.com:hpcgarage/morrigan.git
cd morrigan
git submodule update --init --recursive
... todo ...
source morrigan-env.sh
```

# Testing
SST-Elements comes with an extensive suite of tests, most of which we don't need for this project. Follow these steps to test your installation of this project and the relevant dependencies.

```
... todo ...
```


# Workflow 
As mentioned above, this project relies on custom version of some other projects. If you want to make changes to those projects, you don't need to download them separately -- you can do that right from within this repo. Follow these steps to create changes and push them to our repos.

```
